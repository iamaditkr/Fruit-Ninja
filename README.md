# Fruit-Ninja
The website is based on a game which would be similar to the modern day
Fruit Ninja. You get points on slicing fruits but beware and keep a lookout
for the bombs which instantly end your game on being sliced. Players can be
engaged in a gameplay meanwhile competing by comparing the scores on
the leaderboard.

##Features
• Diﬀerent types of fruits each oﬀering diﬀerent points when sliced
• Fruits spawn randomly from random coordinates of the x-axis, each with a
diﬀerent probability of being spawned
• Game over conditions when a bomb is sliced or user fails to slice three or
more fruits
